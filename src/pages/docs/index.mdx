# ðŸŒŸ Chitra Lekha Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Chitra Lekha** â€“ our stateâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘art image captioning system that leverages a CNN-RNN architecture to generate natural language descriptions for images.


---

## What Is Image Captioning?

Image captioning automatically generates descriptive text for images. Chitra Lekha uses:
- **CNN Encoder**: A ResNet-50 based network to extract deep visual features.
- **LSTM Decoder**: A recurrent neural network that converts these features into coherent captions.

---

## Documentation Overview

This guide is organized as follows:

- **[Model Architecture](./docs/model.mdx)**  
  Learn how the CNN extracts features and how the LSTM decodes them into captions.

- **[Training Process](./docs/training.mdx)**  
  Detailed steps on data preprocessing, training on the COCO dataset, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

- **[Inference](./docs/inference.mdx)**  
  Understand how to generate captions in real time and integrate the model with the Chitra Lekha frontend.

- **[Deployment](./docs/deployment.mdx)**  
  Instructions for deploying the model, including cloud and local setups.

## Quick Start

1. **Explore the Model:**  
   Dive into the [Model Architecture](./docs/model.mdx) to understand how the system works.

2. **Train & Evaluate:**  
   Follow the [Training Process](./docs/training.mdx) to reproduce our results.

3. **Integrate & Deploy:**  
   Check out [Inference](./docs/inference.mdx) and [Deployment](./docs/deployment.mdx) for integration details.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric        | Value  |
|---------------|--------|
| BLEU-4 Score  | 0.30   |
| CIDEr Score   | 0.85   |
| ROUGE-L       | 0.50   |
| METEOR        | 0.27   |

Our model achieves competitive results on the COCO dataset using beam search for better caption generation.
