    question: "What is the Deep Vision Semantics Encoder?",
    answer:
      "Itâ€™s a cutting-edge image captioning engine that leverages a modified ResNet-50 for feature extraction and an LSTM decoder to generate context-aware captions.",
    value: "item-1",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the image captioning process work?",
    answer:
      "Our model first extracts rich visual features using ResNet-50 and then decodes them into natural language descriptions with an LSTM, effectively bridging vision and language.",
    value: "item-2",
  },
  {
    question: "Which dataset is used for training?",
    answer:
      "We train our engine on the COCO dataset, which provides diverse and high-quality image-caption pairs to ensure robust performance.",
    value: "item-3",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate this captioning engine into my application?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. The solution is designed with a modular API, making integration seamless and adaptable to various platforms.",
